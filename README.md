## Hi there, I'm Enrico ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ§ª Iâ€™m a Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie Post-Doctoral Fellow working between the **University of Verona** and the **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill**.

ðŸŽ“ I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Verona in 2019.

ðŸ”§ I develop tools and methods for the efficient simulation and functional safety of embedded platforms that blend analog, digital, and networked components.

ðŸ“š My work spans system-level modeling, circuit fault analysis, and performance under large-signal excitation â€” especially when things get weird and nonlinear.

ðŸ§  Iâ€™m actively working on [MentOS](https://github.com/mentos-team/MentOS), a teaching-oriented operating system â€” and Iâ€™d love help from anyone into low-level C and OS dev!
